# Apex Legends - Loot Quality Map (Kings Canyon Season 5)
A small project to visualize the loot quality of the different areas in Apex Legends. At the moment I've created a single map for Kings Canyon (Season 5). The source for the base-map and the loot quality data is [Gamepedia](https://apexlegends.gamepedia.com/Kings_Canyon). I only did the visualization of the data.

The goal of this map is giving you a rough feeling for the high quality loot areas. Use it to find good landing areas and good rotations across the map. It is **not** intended to be exact and some area borders might be a little off. If you find any major issues - which I am sure do exist in this initial version - please let me know via PM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dementophobia) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dementophobia81) so that I can address them and release a better version.

Feel free to [download](./Kings_Canyon_Loot_Quality_S5_v01.png) the current version, but make sure to check back to get updates and corrections.

**FAQ:**

* Did you forget about Hydro Dam?

  No, Hydro Dam is considered a Low Tier area and is therefore not mentioned explicitly on the map like every other Low Tier area. 

* What about Gold-House?

  Gold-House isn't mentioned on Gamepedia, and so far I am relying only on this single source. I might change this in the future, but for now only data from Gamepedia is considered.
